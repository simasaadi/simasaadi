## Hi there 👋 My name is Sima Saadi

I build decision-support analytics for public-sector and environmental problems. That usually means reproducible data workflows (Python/R/SQL), geospatial analysis, and practical governance + quality controls so the outputs hold up in real operations.

My edge is the combination of **analytics + geospatial + data governance** — I ship work as dashboards, maps, and decision-ready briefs that stay reliable in multi-team, multi-system environments.

**What I do**
- **Data science + analytics engineering:** data cleaning/validation, SQL modeling, KPI design, automated pipelines, and dashboards  
- **GIS + spatial analytics:** ArcGIS/QGIS/PostGIS workflows, spatial joins, hotspot-style analysis, map-based decision products  
- **Data governance in practice:** standards, SOPs, access controls, quality checks, and adoption tools across complex organizations  

**Current focus**
- **Data Governance Functional Model (City of Toronto):** turning governance into operational procedures, controls, and decision products  
- **Environmental + water analytics:** trends, anomalies, and monitoring dashboards for large public datasets  

**Specialties:** analytics engineering · data quality controls · spatial analysis · decision support · governance tooling  
**Stack:** Python · R · SQL (PostgreSQL/PostGIS) · Power BI/Tableau · Streamlit · ArcGIS/QGIS
